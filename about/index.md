# About the Tutorial

[AngularDart](http://angulardart.org) is an exciting new MVC Framework for 
developing large, scalable web apps with the
[Dart Platform](http://dartlangu.org). AngularDart is still in its infancy and
at the time of this writing, there are still very few resources for learning
about the framework. This tutorial hopes to help bridge that gap and get
newcomers up and running.

Dart has had more than its fair share of Pirate-based Tutorials. It was well
time that Ninjas left their mark on the Dart world. The tutorial was inspired
by [Ask A Ninja](http://askaninja.com/) which the author stumbled upon while 
searching for ideas. Please be advised that the author of this tutorial has
no Ninja experience, is not associated with any previous or existing 
[Dojos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo) and makes no claim of accuracy in
any of the background information contained in this site or the tutorials.
