# About the Tutorial

[AngularDart](http://angulardart.org) is an exciting new MVC Framework for 
developing large, scalable web apps with the
[Dart Platform](http://dartlangu.org). AngularDart is still in its infancy and
at the time of this writing, there are still very few resources for learning
about the framework. This tutorial hopes to help bridge that gap and get
newcomers up and running.
