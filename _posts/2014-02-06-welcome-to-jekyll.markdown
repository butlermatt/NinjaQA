Finally getting a start on the AngularDart tutorial I've been planning. I'm still going through the processes of getting
the project skeleton in place and setting up Jekyll for the tutorial pages. I'm still getting the hang of it yet, and not
sure exactly how everything will appear.

Expect some significant changes to the pages in the coming days. Also.. what are you doing reading this!? I haven't even
announced this project officially yet.

Check out the [Project Repo][ninjaqa] for the project files. And the [Tutorial Page][tutorial] for the walkthroughs as
they progress.
